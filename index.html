                        <p>The Philippine economy is the 34th largest in the world, with an estimated 2018 gross
                            domestic product (nominal) of $371.8 billion.[10] Primary exports include semiconductors and
                            electronic products, transport equipment, garments, copper products, petroleum products,
                            coconut oil, and fruits. Major trading partners include the United States, Japan, China,
                            Singapore, South Korea, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Germany, Taiwan, and Thailand. Its
                            unit of currency is the Philippine peso (₱ or PHP).</p>
                        <p>The unemployment rate as of 14 December 2014, stands at 6.0%. Meanwhile, due to
                            lower charges in basic necessities, the inflation rate eases to 3.7% in November. Gross
                            international reserves as of October 2013 are $83.201 billion. The Debt-to-GDP ratio
                            continues to decline to 38.1% as of March 2014 from a record high of 78% in
                            2004. The country is a net importer but it is also a creditor nation.</p>
                        <p>Transportation infrastructure in the Philippines is relatively underdeveloped. This is partly
                            due to mountainous terrain and the scattered geography of the islands, but also the result
                            of consistently low investment in infrastructure by successive governments. In 2013, about
                            3% of national GDP went towards infrastructure development—much lower than many of its
                            neighbors.</p>

                        <p>Historically, Maldives provided enormous quantities of cowry shells, an international
                            currency of the early ages. From the 2nd century AD the islands were known as the 'Money
                            Isles' by the Arabs. Monetaria moneta were used for centuries as a currency in Africa,
                            and huge amounts of Maldivian cowries were introduced into Africa by western nations during
                            the period of slave trade. The cowry is now the symbol of the Maldives Monetary
                            Authority.</p>
                        <p>In the early 1970s, Maldives was one of the world's 20 poorest countries, with a population
                            of 100,000. The economy at the time was largely dependent on fisheries and trading local
                            goods such as coir rope, ambergris (Maavaharu), and coco de mer (Tavakkaashi) with
                            neighboring countries and East Asian countries.</p>
                        <p>The Maldivian government began a largely successful economic reform programme in the 1980s,
                            initiated by lifting import quotas and giving more opportunities to the private sector. At

                        <p>Japan is the third largest national economy in the world, after the United States and China,
                            in terms of nominal GDP, and the fourth largest national economy in the world, after
                            the United States, China and India, in terms of purchasing power parity. As of 2016, Japan's
                            public debt was estimated at more than 230 percent of its annual gross domestic product, the
                            largest of any nation in the world. In August 2011, Moody's rating has cut Japan's
                            long-term sovereign debt rating one notch from Aa3 to Aa2 inline with the size of the
                            country's deficit and borrowing level. The large budget deficits and government debt since
                            the 2009 global recession, followed by the earthquake and tsunami in March 2011, caused the
                            rating downgrade. The service sector accounts for three quarters of the gross domestic
                            product.</p>
                        <p>Japan has a large industrial capacity, and is home to some of the largest and most
                            technologically advanced producers of motor vehicles, electronics, machine tools, steel and
                            nonferrous metals, ships, chemical substances, textiles, and processed foods. Agricultural
                            businesses in Japan cultivate 13 percent of Japan's land, and Japan accounts for nearly 15
                            percent of the global fish catch, second only to China. As of 2016, Japan's labor force
                            consisted of some 65.9 million workers. Japan has a low unemployment rate of around four
                            percent. Some 20 million people, around 17 per cent of the population, were below the
                            poverty line in 2007. Housing in Japan is characterized by limited land supply in urban
                            areas.</p>
